quite clear

1. Let's make more lines shown as moved by git show -w --color-moved:
use the same variable name (say, "DepCache", and not "Cache" or "Dep") in
one of the old commits as in this one after the movement.

2. Write this hint down in the commit message
(to view with "git show -w --color-moved") so that future readers
can reproduce our experience.

Effects on the old bahavior: none (except for a fixed bug in apt-shell perhaps)

If this is an independent bug, wouldn't it be better to fix it in a
separate commit (so that it can be cherry-picked into other versions)?
