Effects on the old bahavior: none

1. Let's make more lines shown as moved by git show -w --color-moved:
use the same variable name (say, "DepCache", and not "Cache" or "Dep") in
one of the old commits as in this one after the movement.

2. Write this hint down in the commit message
(to view with "git show -w --color-moved") so that future readers
can reproduce our experience.
