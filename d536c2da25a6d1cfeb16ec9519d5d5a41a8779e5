Effects on the old behavior: can be either on APT, or on RPM
(modifying the database).

I haven't thoroughly studied this code. I have already got the
understanding that the auto-flags are read or written package by
package. (Before, I used to think that there is a way to get the data
with one sweep.)

Also, an idea/question appeared to me: if this information is stored
in the RPM db, there could be a way to change these flags not by means
of APT, but rather through RPM's command-line interface. Is there
something like this? vseleznv@ said that there is apparently no way to
do this through RPM now, but it has been discussed in RPM mailing
lists.
