This must not change the behavior of old commands, because the calls
to readStateFile() and writeStateFile() do nothing as of now.

I don't understand the comment and the following code yet:

       // In apt-get it's called 'Dir::State::apt_mark_storage', but format used here is incompatible, due to that name is different
       Cnf.CndSet("Dir::State::apt_mark_storage", "apt_mark_storage");

After reading the next commit, I've understood that "apt_mark_storage"
is the default filename where to store the state of the auto-marks.
