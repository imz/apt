1. The parameter name "AptMarkInheritance" does not clarify whether the
"auto" or "manual" mark is set on the condition named by the value of
the parameter (like "at_least_one" etc.); I mean that something like
"AptAutoMarkInheritance" would make it more clear for users looking at
the configuration. Has this paramater name been copied from Debian? If
so, then it's better not change it, probably, although it might be not
very clear.

TODO: review the rest of the code more thoroughly.

2. The spacing (with tabs) in apt/apt-pkg/rpm/rpmsystem.cc is not
consistent with how the code is indented nearby. (Although I don't
like their mix of tabs and spaces, because it assumes that a tab is
always 8 spaces...)

I'd also have a look at the current indentation practice in the
current Debian APT sources, and if they are more sensible I would
probably re-indent according to their rules all our sources before
introducing new changes. (In a hope to exchange some minor patches.)
