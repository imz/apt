The parameter name "AptMarkInheritance" does not clarify whether the
"auto" or "manual" mark is set on the condition named by the value of
the parameter (like "at_least_one" etc.); I mean that something like
"AptAutoMarkInheritance" would make it more clear for users looking at
the configuration. Has this paramater name been copied from Debian? If
so, then it's better not change it, probably, although it might be not
very clear.

TODO: review the rest of the code more thoroughly.
