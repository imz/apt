Effects on the old bahavior: none

1. Let's make more lines shown as moved by git show -w --color-moved:
use the same variable name (say, "DepCache", and not "Cache" or "Dep") in
one of the old commits as in this one after the movement.

It's not stated that it's just a move of code from file to file,
and some changes are made due to change of type of variable:
in removed code it was a pointer to class, now it's a reference.
