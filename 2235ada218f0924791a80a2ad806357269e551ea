3. cerr is changed to m_c1out in this commit, although the rest of the
commit is just about an equiv.rewrite of the code to make it nicer;
this makes the new behavior non-equivalent (in apt/apt-pkg/cachefile.cc):

       {
-        m_c1out << _(" failed.") << endl;
-        ShowBroken(cerr,*this,true);
+         m_c1out << _(" failed.") << std::endl;
+         ShowBroken(m_c1out, *this, true);

          return _error->Error(_("Unable to correct dependencies"));
       }

...

    {
-      m_c1out << _("You might want to run `apt-get --fix-broken install' to correct these.") << endl;
-      ShowBroken(cerr,*this,true);
+      m_c1out << _("You might want to run `install --fix-broken' to correct these.") << std::endl;
+      ShowBroken(m_c1out, *this, true);

       return _error->Error(_("Unmet dependencies. Try using --fix-broken."));
    }
