Effects on the old behavior: none (looks like an equiv.rewrite, have read through)

1. New idea: let's use ioprintf() instead of asprintf() -- as anywhere
else in APT sources. (It comes from apt/apt-pkg/contrib/strutl.h )

BTW (to the discussion of converging with Debian), Debian APT has also
moved utility functions to separate modules (e.g.,
https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt/blob/master/apt-private/private-output.h ).
However, without the additional parameters needed by apt-shell.
(They don't have this apt-shell.)
