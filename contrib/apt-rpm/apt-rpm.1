apt-rpm is a wrapper around apt-get, extending the available arguments of
apt-get with some specific rpm arguments.  apt-rpm does nothing more than
passing the provided arguments to apt-get.  The specific rpm arguments are
converted into the apt-get argument convention, before they are passed to
apt-get.
