This is a simple script that will install all development packages
for packages already in the system, as far as they are suffixed with
"-devel" or "-devel-static". It will also try to string numbers
from the end of the package name, if they are found. This will,
for example, check "libapt-pkg-devel" for a library like "libapt-pkg0".

To use it, just run

    apt-get script ./install-devel.lua
