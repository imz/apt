This script checks packages for known good GPG signatures. Optionally
it can also automatically import GPG keys.
Note that rpm-4.1 or later is required for this functionality.

For the checker functionality to work you must have the following
configuration items set:

Scripts::PM::Pre:: "gpg-check.lua";
RPM::GPG-Check "true";

As a workaround for certain commercial rpm's which break when signed afterwards
you can specify packages not to be checked by adding them to
RPM::GPG::Skip-Check:: list.

A completely optional addon is the ability to automatically import GPG keys
to rpmdb when running apt.
To enable this you need the following configuration items set:

Scripts::Init:: "gpg-import.lua";
RPM::GPG-Import "true";

The importer looks for files in /etc/apt/gpg/ directory and for the keys
to be automatically be named gpg-pubkey-xxx-yyy, where xxx-yyy is the name
the key gets when it's imported into the rpmdb.
