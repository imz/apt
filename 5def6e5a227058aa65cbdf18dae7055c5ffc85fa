quite clear, but: this seems to be 2 logically separate changes

Effects on the old behavior: no
(only errors in MarkAuto() might theoretically affect it)

1. The spacing (for indentation) is not consistent with how the code
is indented nearby in:

apt/apt-pkg/contrib/configuration.cc
apt/apt/apt-pkg/depcache.cc

(Although I don't like their mix of tabs and spaces, because it
assumes that a tab is always 8 spaces... but we must not break the
surrounding spacing/indentation rules.)
