.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
Apt provides a single command line user interface for the following commands: \fB\fBapt\-get\fR\fR(8), \fB\fBapt\-cache\fR\fR(8), \fB\fBapt\-config\fR\fR(8), \fB\fBapt\-cdrom\fR\fR(8) and the \fBrpm\fR query possibilities\&. Besides the single interface it provides some additional options that are specific to apt in combination with rpm\&.

.PP
Unless the \fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR, \fB\-v\fR, or \fB\-\-version\fR option is given one of the commands mentioned in the ACTIONS section must be present\&.

.PP
Detailed information about each apt command and its options can be found in the man pages that belong to the dispatched apt applications\&.

.SH "ACTIONS"

.PP
Actions supported by \fBapt\fR: add, autoclean, build\-dep, check, clean, depends, dist\-upgrade, dotty, dump, dumpavail, gencaches, groupinstall, groupremove, ident, install, list\-extras, list\-nodeps, moo, pkgnames, policy, query, querytags, rdepends\&. reinstall\&. remove, script, search, show, showgroup, showgroups, showpkg, showsrc, source, stats, unmet, update, upgrade, whatdepends, xvcg\&.

.TP
groupinstall
Install a group (or groups) of packages\&. Most often those groups are defined by the distributor\&. Configuration item: Scripts::Groupinstall::Backend

.TP
groupremove
Remove a group (or groups) of packages\&. Most often those groups are defined by the distributor\&. Configuration item: Scripts::Groupinstall::Backend

.TP
list\-nodeps
list all installed packages that are not required by any other installed package\&.

.TP
list\-extras
shows packages not found in any online repositories\&. These are packages downloaded or build and installed locally\&. It's useful to review that list and decide if all those packages are still needed\&. Specifically if the system is used to build packages distributed to other systems\&. It's very important to be aware of all installed non\-standard packages to avoid dependencies that cannot be satisfied from the standard repository\&.

.TP
list\-nodeps
list all installed packages that are not required by any other installed package\&.

.TP
reinstall
installs a package again, even if the package is already installed\&.

.TP
showgroup
Provide information about group (or groups)\&. Most often those groups are defined by the distributor\&. Configuration item: Scripts::Groupinstall::Backend

.TP
showgroups
Show available groups\&. Most often those groups are defined by the distributor\&. Configuration item: Scripts::Groupinstall::Backend

.PP
The functionality of the remaining actions are provided by other apt tools\&. The actions listed by their respective command:

.TP
\fBapt\-get\fR
autoclean, build\-dep, check, clean, dist\-upgrade, install, moo, remove, reinstall\&. script, source, update, upgrade\&.

.TP
\fBapt\-cache\fR
add, depends, dotty, dump, dumpavail, gencaches, pkgnames, policy, rdepends\&. search, show, showpkg, showsrc, stats, unmet, whatdepends, xvcg\&.

.TP
\fBapt\-config\fR
shell, dump\&.

.TP
\fBapt\-cdrom\fR
add, ident\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-\-checksig\fR
checks the integrity and origin of the candidate packages to be installed\&. If the check fails for 1 or more packages non of the candidate packages will be installed! In case the signature check fails use the \-\-hold argument to keep back the offending package(s) or use the \-\-no\-checksig argument to skip the package integrity check\&. More about package checking can be found in the rpm manual\&. Configuration item: RPM::GPG\-Check\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-hold\fR
puts a package on hold\&. A package on hold won't be upgraded unless overruled with the install action\&. Repeat this option if multiple packages must be kept from upgrading\&. This option uses regular expressions to find the package to be put on hold\&. E\&.g\&. in case the package "at" must be hold, it must be specified as \-\-hold ^at$, if not done like this a package like attr will be put on hold as well\&. In any case it is better to put packages on hold with the rpm::hold variable in the file \fIapt\&.conf\fR!

.TP
\fB\-\-no\-checksig\fR
Do not check the integrity of the packages to be installed\&. It can be used if the integrity check fails for 1 or more packages, but the packages have been obtained from a save origin\&. Configuration item: RPM::GPG\-Check\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-no\-postscript\fR
Do not run a postscript after packages have been upgraded, degraded, removed or installed\&. Configuration item: Scripts::Options::RunPostScript\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-postscript\fR
Run a postscript after packages have been upgraded, degraded, removed or installed\&. The script to use is specified with configuration item: Scripts::PM::Post::\&. With this option it is possible to run for example ldconfig or a distribution specific configuration script\&. Configuration item: Scripts::Options::RunPostScript\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-show\-rpm\-command\fR
Shows the exact rpm command to be performed, during install, upgrade or dist\-upgrade actions\&. The action itself will not be performed\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-sourceslist\fR
Select the sourceslist file to be used (default is \fI/etc/apt/sources\&.list\fR)\&.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show a short usage summary\&.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Show the program version\&.

.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-config\-file\fR
Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use\&. The program will read the default configuration file and then this configuration file\&. See \fB\fIapt\&.conf\fR\fR(5) for syntax information\&.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-option\fR
Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitary configuration option\&. The syntax is \fB\-o Foo::Bar=bar\fR\&.

.SH "RPM OPTIONS"

.PP
Options handed over to \fBrpm\fR, see rpm man page for their functionality\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-test\fR
\fBRpm\fR option \-\-test\&.

If APT_VERBOSE is defined \fBapt\fR will show which application is being dispatched\&.

.SH "CAVEATS"

.PP
There are 2 apt actions, add and dump, that are used by several apt commands\&. The action add is used by \fBapt\-cdrom\fR and \fBapt\-cache\fR\&. \fBapt\fR uses add from \fBapt\-cdrom\&.\fR The action dump is used by \fBapt\-config\fR and \fBapt\-cache\fR\&. \fBapt\fR uses dump from \fBapt\-config\fR\&.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
