This script will handle Allow-Duplicated packages when more
than one is available during an install operation, and will
also upgrade these packages in a dist-upgrade operation.

For the dist-upgrade operation, only those packages matching
a regular expression in the RPM::Allow-Duplicated-Upgrade
option will be affected.

For example, suppose that the following packages are
available:

	kernel26#2.6.2-48393cl 2.6.2-48393cl [Installed]
	kernel26#2.6.0-41929cl 2.6.0-41929cl [Installed]
	kernel26#2.6.1-44677cl 2.6.1-44677cl [Installed]
	kernel26#2.6.3-50659cl 2.6.3-50659cl

If you try to install the package "kernel26", you'll usually
get a message that these packages are available, and you must
select one of them.

With this script plugged into the necessary slots, the 2.6.3
version will be correctly selected for installation in
the "install kernel26" operation is performed. It will also
be selected for installation if you perform a dist-upgrade
operation with something like this in your configuration:

	RPM::Allow-Duplicated-Upgrade:: "kernel.*";
