This script will log the changes being introduced by
the transaction which is going to be run, and is based
on an idea of Panu Matilainen.

This script must be plugged in the slots:

    Scripts::PM::Pre
    Scripts::PM::Post

Then, when some transaction is run, it will dump information
about it in /var/log/apt.log, or in the configured file.
