1. Since unique_ptr is from C++11, the initialization can be probably
also done nicer than with memset -- https://stackoverflow.com/a/7546745/94687 :

  new T[n]()

2. sizeof(*List) (2 times) looked less prone to errors (possible after
type modifications in future) than the new code:
sizeof(pkgCache::Package*)
