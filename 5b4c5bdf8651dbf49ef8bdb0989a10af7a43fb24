1. Since unique_ptr is from C++11, the initialization can be probably
also done nicer than with memset -- https://stackoverflow.com/a/7546745/94687 :

  new T[n]()

2. sizeof(*List) (2 times) looked less prone to errors (possible after
type modifications in future) than the new code:
sizeof(pkgCache::Package*)

3. cerr is changed to m_c1out in this commit, although the rest of the
commit is just about an equiv.rewrite of the code to make it nicer;
this makes the new behavior non-equivalent (in apt/apt-pkg/cachefile.cc):

    {
-      m_c1out << _("You might want to run `apt-get --fix-broken install' to correct these.") << endl;
-      ShowBroken(cerr,*this,true);
+      m_c1out << _("You might want to run `install --fix-broken' to correct these.") << std::endl;
+      ShowBroken(m_c1out, *this, true);

       return _error->Error(_("Unmet dependencies. Try using --fix-broken."));
    }
