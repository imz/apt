quite clear, although this seems to be 2 logically separate changes

Effects on the old behavior: no
(only errors in MarkAuto() might theoretically affect it)

1. The spacing (with tabs) in apt/apt-pkg/rpm/rpmsystem.cc is not
consistent with how the code is indented nearby. (Although I don't
like their mix of tabs and spaces, because it assumes that a tab is
always 8 spaces...)

I'd also have a look at the current indentation practice in the
current Debian APT sources, and if they are more sensible I would
probably re-indent according to their rules all our sources before
introducing new changes. (In a hope to exchange some minor patches.)
