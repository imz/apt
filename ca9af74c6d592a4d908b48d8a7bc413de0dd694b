This code uses the filename from the config parameter introduced in
the prev.commit. A few things are not clear in the code:

1. What the value of delim_index is expected to be here? In the default value (from prev.commit) there is no '/'.

               AptMarkTempFileName = AptMarkStorageFileName.substr(0, delim_index + 1) + ".__tmp__apt_mark_storage";

2. Why is iter not dereferenced here:

                               linestr = iter.Name();

though its other previous uses are written with dereferencing, e.g.:

                       StateCache const &stateCache = PkgState[iter->ID];
