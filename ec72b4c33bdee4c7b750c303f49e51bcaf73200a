Effects on the old behavior: This does not change the behavior of old
commands, because the calls to read/writeStateFile() do nothing as of
now.

1. I don't understand the comment and the following code yet:

       // In apt-get it's called 'Dir::State::apt_mark_storage', but format used here is incompatible, due to that name is different
       Cnf.CndSet("Dir::State::apt_mark_storage", "apt_mark_storage");

After reading the next commit, I've understood that "apt_mark_storage"
is the default filename where to store the state of the auto-marks.

2. Although not important for us (and the behavior), the deletion of a
special comment in apt/apt-pkg/depcache.cc is strange (and unexplained):

@@ -665,7 +667,15 @@ void pkgDepCache::Update(PkgIterator const &Pkg)
         Update(P.ParentPkg().RevDependsList());
 }

-                                                                       /*}}}*/

3. The spacing (with tabs) in apt/apt-pkg/rpm/rpmsystem.cc is not
consistent with how the code is indented nearby. (Although I don't
like their mix of tabs and spaces.)
